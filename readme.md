*I have commited a first attempt at this project, since learning more about JS I have come back to it to re-factor some code and also to add more functions. I have used the DOM in the second commit and also added some CSS and an image.*


It is still a work in progress...



Create a bank machine challenge.

What will we need to complete this project:

(creat an options menu for the user to choose the required service. I will try a switch statement.)

1. Ability to take a pin number from the user. I will use either a user input or prompt.

2. Check the user pin is correct before letting someone access their account - 3 attempts maximum. I can
create a loop, or an 'if.. else' statement without a loop. Which will control the number of pin attempts.
and validate the correct pin. (Maybe i can create two functions - one to manage the attempts and
another to validate the pin entry by matching it to the correct pin number (predermined in the array)   


3. Withdraw from their bank account  - a. Check withdrawals for the day, a limit of £250 per day is allowed. 

4.Deposit into their account up to £250 a time... isn’t so straightforward when we get to prompts.  - maybe try input value.

5. Change the user pin with validation - try to replace the index of the loop where the old pin sits?

6. Check balance. - (Keep variable global in order to cancatinate it to the alert later. )

7. Statement of actions of the transactions occurred.

9. Change currency (cyrrency converter).

10. Savings account optional.
